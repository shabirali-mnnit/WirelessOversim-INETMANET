This example requires the openssl library. To run the example, follow the steps below:

1. Install openssl (a.o., libssl, libssl-dev). Use project properties->omnet++->makemake->options to link it. If you have any questions regarding this issue don't hesitate to send a mail to mohamad.sbeiti@tu-dortmund.de
2. Uncomment #define OPENSSL_IS_LINKED in /src/generic/Configuration.h
3. Recompile inetmanet

That is it, now you can run the example.
